        <h1>Our Journey</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Founded in Sokoto, March 30</strong>, 2018 Prokip began its
          journey in Sokoto, one of Nigeria’s poorest cities, with a vision: to
          bring powerful business management tools to even the most underserved
          regions. We wanted to ensure that businesses, no matter their
          location, had the resources to grow and thrive. <br /><br />

          Starting in Sokoto offered us invaluable insight into the unique
          challenges that business owners face in rural, less connected areas.
          From unreliable internet access to traditional business practices, we
          understood the gaps and tailored our platform to bridge these
          challenges with modern digital solutions.

          <br /><br />
          Since then, Prokip has expanded far beyond Sokoto. Today, we empower
          thousands of businesses across Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, and
          Rwanda, helping them manage operations more efficiently and unlock new
          growth potential.

          <br /><br />

          Our platform has become a lifeline for both bustling urban enterprises
          and small rural shops.

          <br /><br />

          And we’re not done yet. Our mission is to ensure that every business,
          no matter how remote or resource-limited, can access world-class
          management tools and thrive.

          <br /><br />

          Together, we’re transforming Africa’s business landscape—one
          entrepreneur at a time
